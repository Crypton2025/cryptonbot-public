# Roadmap (Public Snapshot)

This roadmap outlines the current engineering focus areas for CryptonBot.
It reflects development priorities and technical direction, not delivery dates
or performance promises.

The public repository contains architectural and validation materials only.
Core production logic remains private by design.

## Near-Term Focus Areas

### 1. Reliability & Failure Handling
- Explicit failure modes and recovery paths
- Safe restarts and state reconciliation
- Idempotent operations across critical components

### 2. Observability & Diagnostics
- Health checks and system-level metrics
- Clear separation of signals vs. execution state
- Improved visibility into system behavior under load

### 3. Validation & Test Coverage
- Expanded structural and integration tests
- Clear validation boundaries for public vs. private components
- Continued emphasis on reproducibility and correctness

### 4. Architecture Refinement
- Cleaner module boundaries and interfaces
- Reduced coupling between strategies and execution layers
- Documentation of design trade-offs and constraints

### 5. Documentation & Transparency
- Incremental public documentation updates
- Additional sanitized reports and design notes
- Clear communication of what is intentionally excluded

This roadmap is intentionally conservative.
Progress prioritizes system stability, clarity, and safety over feature expansion.
