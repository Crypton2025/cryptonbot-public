# cryptonbot-public
Public community repository for CryptonBot — architecture, documentation, and selected code samples.
# CryptonBot — Public Community Repository

CryptonBot is an independent software engineering project focused on building a **reliable, risk-aware, and fail-safe crypto trading system**.

This repository is a **public-facing community repo** created to demonstrate the project’s architecture, engineering approach, and development philosophy — without exposing sensitive production logic.

---

## What is CryptonBot?

CryptonBot is **not** a signal service, not asset management, and not a “guaranteed profit” product.

It is an engineering-driven trading system designed to:
- reduce human error and emotional decision-making,
- enforce discipline and risk control,
- provide transparent system behavior,
- operate safely in testnet and paper-trading environments.

The project prioritizes **stability, observability, and correctness** over aggressive performance claims.

---

## Why this repository is public

This repository exists to:

- demonstrate **system architecture and engineering quality**,
- provide **documentation and design insights**,
- allow technical users to evaluate the project’s approach,
- build **trust through transparency**, without compromising security.

⚠️ **This is NOT the full production codebase.**

Some components are intentionally excluded.

---

## What is included

✅ High-level architecture overview  
✅ Core system concepts (FSM, adapters, async design)  
✅ API & observability approach  
✅ Documentation and roadmap  
✅ Selected, non-sensitive code examples  
✅ Public testnet / paper-trading concepts  

---

## What is NOT included

🚫 Proprietary trading strategies  
🚫 Production risk models and parameters  
🚫 Machine learning weights and training pipelines  
🚫 Exchange credentials or live trading logic  
🚫 Internal security mechanisms  

These components remain private by design.

---

## Architecture Overview

At a high level, CryptonBot is built around:

- **Asynchronous core (async/await)**  
- **Finite State Machine (FSM)** for lifecycle control  
- **Exchange adapters** (e.g. Binance, testnet-first)  
- **Strategy abstraction layer**  
- **Risk management as a first-class concern**  
- **Observability-first design** (metrics, health checks, alerts)

The system is designed to fail safely, not silently.

Detailed documentation can be found in the `/docs` directory.

---

## Development Philosophy

- Safety > Profit claims  
- Deterministic behavior > “AI magic”  
- Testnet and paper trading first  
- Explicit risk limits  
- Transparent failure modes  
- No hidden promises  

This project is built as an **engineering system**, not a marketing product.

---

## Roadmap (High-Level)

- Public architecture & documentation (current)
- Community feedback and discussion
- Extended test coverage and benchmarks
- Additional exchange adapters
- Advanced strategies (private)
- Optional cloud deployment
- Gradual feature expansion based on stability

The roadmap is intentionally conservative.

---
## Validation & Quality

A sanitized test and validation report is available here:

- docs/quality/test-report-2025-07-06.md

This report demonstrates system integrity, testing approach,
and engineering discipline without exposing proprietary logic.

## Support the Project

CryptonBot is developed independently and requires ongoing work:
- infrastructure and servers,
- testing and monitoring,
- documentation,
- long-term maintenance.
