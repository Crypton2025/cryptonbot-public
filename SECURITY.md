# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

The CryptonBot public repository is a **sanitized, non-production snapshot** of an internal engineering project.  
It intentionally excludes live trading logic, credentials, and proprietary components.

If you believe you have found a security issue related to:
- exposed secrets,
- unintended access paths,
- unsafe defaults in public materials,
- or any potential vulnerability that could affect users,

please **do not open a public GitHub issue**.

Instead, report the issue privately.

## How to Report

Send a brief description to:

- Email: contact@cryptonbot.dev

Please include:
- a clear description of the issue,
- steps to reproduce (if applicable),
- affected files or documentation references.

You do **not** need to provide exploit code.

## Scope

This security policy applies only to the **public-facing repository** and its documentation.

It does **not** cover:
- private repositories,
- internal infrastructure,
- production trading systems,
- proprietary strategies or configurations.

## Responsible Disclosure

Security reports are reviewed on a best-effort basis.  
Confirmed issues will be addressed and mitigated where appropriate.

Public disclosure should only occur **after** the issue has been reviewed and resolved.

This project prioritizes safety, transparency, and responsible engineering practices.
